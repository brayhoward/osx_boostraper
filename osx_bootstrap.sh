# Bootstrap script for setting up a new OSX machine
#
# This should be idempotent so it can be run multiple times.
#
# Some apps don't have a cask and so still need to be installed by hand. These
# include:
#
# - Twitter (app store)
# - Postgres.app (http://postgresapp.com/)
#
# Notes:
#
# - If installing full Xcode, it's better to install that first from the app
#   store before running the bootstrap script. Otherwise, Homebrew can't access
#   the Xcode libraries as the agreement hasn't been accepted yet.
